/**
 * The Fibonacci sequence, simply put is a series of numbers where the next in the series is the sum of the previous two numbers.
 * It is also a classic problem in programming tech interviews. There are two ways of solving it.
 * The first is through procedural programming, which will be the first challenge.
 * The second is through recursive function calling whill be the second challenge.
 * Doing it recursively can be very computationally expensive, so be careful! And see how you can improve performance.
 * The answers, as always, will be in the solution section if you're stuck.
 *
 * Both will take a number as input which will be the Nth number in the sequence
 *
 * NOTE: assume that the fibonnaci sequence starts with 0 and 1 and will have the following sequence
 * 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...
